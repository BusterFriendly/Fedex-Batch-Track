Fedex-Batch-Track
=================

batch tracking for fedex with GUI and excel support

Need Tkinter installed  with python... I have successfully been able to package this with py2exe into an executable if you want to do that.

You can use the track.py as a stand alone module to track packages

You can batch track by uploading an excel file via the GUI and designating a column with the tracking numbers in it
as well as an output file for the results.   
you can also batch track using the trackitall.py module as a standalone

Takes 1-2 seconds per tracking number on an average internet connection
